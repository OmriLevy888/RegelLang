If a function is declared within another function, is cannot access variables
in the containing function as that would create weird lifetime situations.

Visitor classes for definitions.

TODO:
  - Definition order
  - Globals
  - Variables from outer functions not available in inner functions

Important change:
-----------------
A function declaration may only have a name if it is the only expression in the
current ExpressionStatement, therefore, these are the only functions that can be
referenced even if they are declared after the place of reference.
